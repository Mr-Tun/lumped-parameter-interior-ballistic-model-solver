# lumped-parameter-interior-ballistic-model-solver
This code solves the classical lumped-parameter model of interior ballistic (zero-dimensional interior ballistic equations）using the 4th order Range–Kutta differential scheme.
Specifically，give the example for xxx 57mm caliber anti-aircraft gun. 
Moverover, the validation and more details of this codes can go through the book INTERIOR BALLISTIC OF GUNS written by Prof. Jin and Prof. Zhang
